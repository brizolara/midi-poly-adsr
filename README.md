# midi-poly-adsr
Pure Data. Generate polyphonic audio from MIDI input, applying a ADSR envelope and configuring pitch step size, allowing for microtonal use.

Arturia MINILab MIDI controller is mapped by default.

It is using MAESTRO and FLUX-PRESET-WAVEFORMS modules from XOdular ECOSystem - a creation of Johan Ericsson Degerlund - but other audio generators are present in the patch as options.
